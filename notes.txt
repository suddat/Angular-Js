"With Your Two Eyes"

Two eyes, with your two eyes,
You tied me and pulled me but that's not enough for you,
Then, with a slight smile, with your naughty smile,
You pushed me away and ran to hide

Some days I think of coming and speaking to you
But, when in front of you
I decide that just your look is enough and so
I will move away without talking to you

Both of your eyes are writing,
a colourful poem, called love,
There is no word, no sound in it,
But it is possible to read it even in darkness.

It is neither day nor night,
Will I be able to spend such time with you,
Which prevent us from being touched,
Will such distances be reduced at that time.

I wish to lean on your lap,
But on the other hand shyness prevents me from doing so,
This is a story which I have not yet told anyone else.

Two eyes, with your two eyes,
You tied me and pulled me but that's not enough for you,
Then, with a slight smile, with your naughty smile,
You pushed me away and ran to hide

A place where strains don't reach and the wind does not blow,
My heart was being such a place how did you enter it,
Without having any body nor possess any shape,
Like God you came and mixed yourself with me.

I don't have any other thought other than you
Now onward my soul is not mine
No barrier for me to come with you even in death.

Both of your eyes are writing,
a colourful poem, called love,
There is no word, no sound in it,
But it is possible to read it even in darkness.

Some days I think of coming and speaking to you
But, when in front of you
I decide that just your look is enough and so
I will move away without talking to you

Two eyes, with your two eyes,
You tied me and pulled me but that's not enough for you,
Then, with a slight smile, with your naughty smile,
You pushed me away and ran to hide.
